# Task-Board

For this weeks challenge, my task was to create a full functional kanban board. I had not finished the project completely as I had struggled with a lot of the javascript. Starting off the project I had created a modal but it was not functioning so I had removed it from my html code. I think the issue was largely due to me not finishing the date picker java script so, it would delete all information filled out into the fields. Firstly, I created two variables to parse the data in local storage. I then worked on the creating task card function as it was easier because I used a lot of the code from previous activities.
